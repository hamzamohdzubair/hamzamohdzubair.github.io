{"pages":[{"tags":"Miscellaneous","title":"About","text":"My name is Hamza Mohd Zubair. I am a Data Science/Stat/ AI enthusiast. I like playing with random data. I believe every data has some insight. And the best way to get it is by looking at it. I love R and use it to for visualizations. I use Jupyter for my analysis. This blog was entirely written in Jupyter (except this page which is a simple markdown file). Pelican was used to generate HTML files and github for deployment. Some of my posts discuss the process of doing it.","url":"https://hamzamohdzubair.github.io/about"}]}
